# opencv-android
Easy way to integrate OpenCv into your Android project via Gradle. No NDK dependency needed - just include this library and you are good to go.  Disclamer: The GitHub project is not (yet) intended to be used as module dependency. Include one of this dependencies in your module's build.gradle dependencies section.
